Employee Age and Retirement Analysis Script

Overview
This script processes an employee dataset to analyze age distribution, calculate the time until retirement for each employee, and visualize the results. It reads employee data from a CSV file, extracts the date of birth information, calculates the age of each employee, determines how many years they have left until retirement, and generates several plots to help visualize these findings.

Features
CSV File Reading: Reads and preprocesses employee data from a CSV file.
Date of Birth Extraction: Extracts and cleans the date of birth column from the dataset.
Age Calculation: Calculates the current age of each employee based on their date of birth.
Retirement Calculation: Determines the number of years remaining until each employee reaches the retirement age of 68.
Data Visualization: Generates various plots:
Age Distribution: Histogram showing the distribution of employee ages.
Years Until Retirement: Bar plot displaying how many years each employee has until retirement.
Age vs. Date of Birth: Scatter plot comparing employees' ages with their date of birth.
Cumulative Retirement Over Time: Line plot showing the cumulative number of employees reaching retirement over time.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For generating plots and visualizations.
